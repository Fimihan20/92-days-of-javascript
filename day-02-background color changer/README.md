 Day 2 – Background Color Changer
Yo hoo! It’s Day 2 of 92 Days of JavaScript challenge.
I was just as curious as you might be now, wondering how colors magically change when you click a button. Well, let me walk you through how it works!

What I Built:
I created a button in HTML that, when clicked, changes the background color of the page randomly.

<button onclick="changeColor()">Change Color</button>

diving straight to What I Learned in the javascript:
const: A way to declare a variable 

Arrays in JavaScript:
A list of values stored in square brackets like this:
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue", "yellow", "purple"];

Math.floor(): Rounds down a number to the nearest whole number
(e.g. Math.floor(3.9) gives 3)

Math.random(): Generates a random decimal between 0 and 1
(e.g. 0.43, 0.92)

document.body.style.backgroundColor: Targets the HTML <body> and changes its background color.

My Analogy:
It’s like having a wall and a shelf of paint buckets. When you press the button, it randomly picks one bucket and splat! it paints the wall with that color.

Hope this helps you visualize what’s happening under the hood!
Let’s meet again tomorrow . same time, same fire
