#Day 0 - Day 0: Welcome to the Challenge!

Hey everyone! I’m super excited to kick off the 92 Days JavaScript Challenge. A personal commitment to learn, build, and grow every single day with JavaScript.

What is JavaScript?
JavaScript is a powerful programming language that helps websites interact, calculate, and respond to users. From animations to form validation, JavaScript makes websites come alive!

Why a 92-Day Challenge?
Honestly? JavaScript used to feel like a huge mountain to me.
I thought I needed some “special method” to understand it. But the truth is ….. the mountain isn’t real. What I needed was a better way to learn.

This challenge is that new way.

I’ll be building 92 different JavaScript projects. From simple to advanced, while breaking down every concept into easy, understandable bits.

What To Expect:
Mini to Big Projects
Explained concepts in simple terms
Fun, interactive learning
Daily snapshots
Consistency & encouragement
What Do You Need?

Just your readiness.
Follow along. Code. Recode. Snap. Repeat.
Learning happens when you practice and experiment.

Let’s Begin Tomorrow with Day 1!
Trust me! it’s going to be worth it. Let’s take this journey together..
Let’s make JavaScript fun again!
